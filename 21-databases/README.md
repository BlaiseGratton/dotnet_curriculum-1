# Introduction to Databases

###### Sonda's Notes:  What is a database?
A database is a data store. Databases logically organize data into an abstraction of real-world concepts.
Database is often abbreviated to DB.

### ACID Model

"In computer science, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably. In the context of databases, a single logical operation on the data is called a transaction. For example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single transaction." [Wikipedia]


###### Sonda's Notes:  What is a DBMS?
A DBMS is a database management system.
Databases and database management systems are different concepts. The database is the data and the metadata (for example, indexes) about that data.
The database management system is the software used to access and manipulate the data stored in the database. This is typically referred to as the CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete).
